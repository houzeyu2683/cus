Ubuntu is a great linux system for everything. When you install it, there are some softwares is not useful for you.
For example, snap store, firefox, etc. 
Then some softwares we must be install but there are not in default system, like anydesk, vscode, chromium, etc.
So I write the script for install it, the script also contain some setting.
The other main idea is the shortcut, everyone should create own shortcut for using system.
In my point, `alt` base shortcut should focus on window, like close, zoom, move, etc.
`meta` or `super` base should open or run some applications, like guake, gnome-terminal, screen shot, etc.
`ctrl` base don't change it, because there are a lot of hotkey already use it, like copy, paste, etc.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Go to **I** folder, then `sh integration.sh`.
3. Go to **II** folder, then `sh integration.sh`

Future work, complete some scripts in **III** folder.
